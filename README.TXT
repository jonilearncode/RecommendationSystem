This capstone project is a DIY NETFLIX or AMAZON recommendation system like.

This program creates an list output, for each new clientID profile, as a Rater object.
The output list content is a sort of recommended movies, from a MovieDatabase, build accordingly the specific likes of this
clientID.

The recommended movies are picked with a specific algorithm. This algorithm select the top rated movies and performs 
a dot product for each Rater object in RaterDatabase. So, the final list, is build accordingly predicting the clientID taste 
with other similar movie ratings from the all Raters in RaterDatabase.

The output movie list can be tunned with specific filters as genre, duration, year, directors, etc...

The program can be build in a back-end perspective for a webpage, and have the ReccomendationRunner class for the printing/display
the results directly in html with css at the webpage. Just consult this class description for more details.

The purpose and objective of this capstone project was to implement the Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals using:
Java, HTML and CSS as languages.

Skills practiced:
- 7 step problem solving;
- Databases;
- Interfaces and re-factoring;
- Debbuging and test runs;
- Software design and development, trough the client product intends, sketching, designing, creation, 
implementation, test and software deploy.
